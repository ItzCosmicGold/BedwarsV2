# Materials
materials:
  # Should the materials file be regenerated on startup

  # [!] It is discouraged to make change to "regular" blocks, such as AIR/WATER/LAVA/DIRT/COBBLESTONE/vanilla tools/...,
  #     because some plugins will more than likely attempt to use them. For AIR/WATER/LAVA/..., it is VERY discouraged.
  #     Bugs caused by those changes (such as world block replacement or item loss) will be disregarded.
  # [!] Beware that materials won't be updated automatically anymore if set to false
  #     You should know that all the combinations in the materials file obviously haven't all been tested individually
  #     They be fixed over time when users report bugs, so it is highly recommended to leave this option enabled to get those fixes automatically in future updates.
